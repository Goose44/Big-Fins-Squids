<h2>Bigfin squids are a group of rarely<br> seen cephalopods with a distinctive morphology. They are placed in the genus Magnapinna and family<br> Magnapinnidae.[2] Although the family is known only from larval, paralarval, and juvenile <br>specimens, some authorities believe adult specimens have also been seen. Several videos have been<br> taken of animals nicknamed the "long-arm squid", which appear to have a similar morphology. Since<br> none of the seemingly adult specimens has ever been captured or sampled, it remains uncertain if<br> they are of the same genus or only relatives.

The arms and tentacles of the squid <br>are both extremely long and believed to be 4 to 8 m (13 to 26 ft) long. These appendages are held<br> perpendicular to the body, creating "elbows." How the squid feeds is yet to be discovered. They were also discovered not too long ago so we don't know much about them!</h2>

<center><h3>The first visual record of the long-arm squid was in September 1988. The crew of the submersible Nautile encountered<br>
 a long-armed squid off the coast of northern Brazil, 10°42.91′N 40°53.43′W, at a depth of 4,735 metres (15,535 ft). In <br>
July 1992, the Nautile again encountered these creatures, first observing one individual two times during a dive off the <br>
coast of Ghana at 3°40′N 2°30′W and 3,010 metres (9,880 ft) depth, and then another one off Senegal at 2,950 metres (9,680 ft).<br>
[verification needed] Both were filmed and photographed.[9] In November 1998, the Japanese crewed submersible Shinkai 6500<br>
 filmed another long-armed squid in the Indian Ocean south of Mauritius, at 32°45′S 57°13′E and 2,340 metres (7,680 ft).</h3></center>
